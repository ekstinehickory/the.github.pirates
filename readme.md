The Github Pirates is an attempt to make sense of the large amount of frontend web-development gold that exists on Github at the moment. Every now and then, I check the wonderful resource, [Pinboard][1], and more often than not - find a bit of JS/CSS/HTML5 gold pushed to Github. Github been around a while now, and as any web developer knows, it can be hard to sift through the noise that is currently abound on Github; particularly over the 6 months, I have seen a rise of fellow githubbers releasing pretty much everything they have in their arsenal of Web development tools.  
  
Whilst this is important, and shouldn't go overlooked, I feel, as ever, there is a large propensity towards noise as a result.  
Enter [The Github Pirates][2]. You see, I roam the Github badlands, late at night, in search for trinkets and gems of web development awesome-sauce.  
  
When I download the scripts, I often feel I own a bit of history, because as anyone will tell you - the internet is forever changing. Sure, all the mega-brands, and mega-sites will always be there, but I often feel compelled to mirror things when I get an inkling it won't be around much longer.  
  
Github shutting down? Well hardly, but they are a free service, and I am always wary of anything 'free' on the net. Especially 'services' that honeypot user generated content. Sure, Github has paid plans for the big boys, but I do worry about everyday Joe who relies on Github on a daily basis to sustain his repo indefinetly, and keep it there when times get bad.

The Chest is a collection of handpicked repos gathered from all over Github, and hosted / backed up at various multiple locations for the following reasons:  
  


*   Ease of reference
*   Quality
*   Preservation
*   Exposure

  
The repos you submit must be coded in either HTML5/CSS3, or JavaScript.  
  
The project is a community based effort, and invites users of any skill level to suggest additions, or modifications to the project.  
  
Once your project has been submitted through the [Wiki][4], it will be reviewed by [The Curator,][3] and added to the main repo. As mentioned earlier, if you want a little more exposure for your repo, this is where you do it. The Curator is looking for high-quality code only. Please read the description about what constitutes high-quality before submitting:  
  


*   Is it generally bad-ass enough to be shared with a large audience?
*   Is it 'bleeding edge'? i.e: Does it use non-standard CSS3 / CSS4 properties?
*   Is the code light-weight? Is the code elegant? Is the code easy to maintain?
*   Does the code perform well? Is it CPU-Fan friendly?
*   Is it new? If not, how does it improve upon existing solutions?
*   Is the code peer-reviewed by others? Is it influenced by others?
*   Can the code run-from-anywhere? i.e: Unzip, open index.html, and run?
*   None of the above? Fear not, [The Curator ][3]doesn't believe in rules anyways.
*   These are _guides_ and you should pay attention to them before submitting
